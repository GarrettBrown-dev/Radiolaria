Hello! And welcome to my initial proposal for Capstones! These ARE listed in my README, but I will have them here for grading purposes.

Description: 
Recreation of an old DS software! Sound-based, simple and fun to mess around with! The idea is to get it looking like the Hanenbow template! (1:36), although if I can, I'd like to eventually recreate them all!: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttFoK8BTXM4&t=1401s

Tech Stack:  
-JS 
-Canvas.js 
-Tone.js 
-Three.js??? 
-Matter.js??? 
-????????? 
-A LOT of Monster, Redbull, and a whole lot of luck. 
-Your love and support? c:

MVP's:
-Explore Tone.js, THREE.js, and Matter.js as options for project.
-Create an environment reminiscent of the "Hanenbow" Template: A basic green background, with a simple "Plant."
-Create objects that, on collision, create a sound.
-Allow player to have control of at least one object on screen
-Have a friggin awesome time!

Stretch Goals:
-Create all templates from the original game!
-Allow users to save their layouts or rhythms for future use!
-Create new templates for the world to enjoy!
-The world relizes this is the future of music making and buys the idea off me, (With proper credit to Toshio) and gives me a billion dollars in royalties when Cher does another album exclusively using Radiolaria as the instrumental software.
